# QuickOCR
A simple OCR tool implemented in Python using tesseract that allows you to copy text from a selected area of the screen to the clipboard.

## Prerequisites
`pip3 install pyperclip pynput pytesseract tkinter pynput`

## Installation
I suggest to store the project files in `~/bin/quick-ocr/`.
Make sure that the `main.py` file is executable (`chmod +x main.py`).
Then you can assign a shortcut in the settings as follows: `~/bin/quick-ocr/main.py` (with a custom shortcut like `Win + Shift + T`).
